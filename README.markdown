Solutions to various coding exercises I've encountered.

FizzBuzz
--------

The program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, one per line. But for multiples
of three it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five it prints "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints "FizzBuzz".
